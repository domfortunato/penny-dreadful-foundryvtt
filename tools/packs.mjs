/**
 * A BUILD IS DESTRUCTIVE WHENEVER SOMEONE HAS EDITED A COMPENDIUM IN FOUNDRY.
 *
 * `build` rmSyncs each pack and recompiles it from YAML, so anything edited
 * inside the world since the last `extract` is gone — and `packs/` is
 * gitignored, LevelDB keeps no history, and Foundry writes no automatic
 * backups. On 2026-08-04 that destroyed roughly five hours of monster art
 * assignment plus a description fix, with no recovery path at all: the newest
 * Volume Shadow Copy predated the work.
 *
 * "packs/ is generated output" is true right up until someone edits a
 * compendium in the world, and from that moment it holds the ONLY copy. The
 * header of this file says the YAML is the source of truth, which is the
 * intent — but intent is not a safeguard, and the destructive direction ran
 * with nothing standing in front of it.
 *
 * So: before building, EXTRACT packs/ to a scratch directory and compare it to
 * a SYNC MARKER — a fingerprint of what packs/ held the last time build or
 * extract left the two sides agreeing. Unchanged since then means the build is
 * a safe regeneration; changed means somebody edited a compendium in Foundry
 * and the build would eat it.
 *
 * TWO WRONG DESIGNS CAME FIRST, and both are worth naming because each looked
 * obviously right:
 *
 *   mtime. Useless. LevelDB rewrites CURRENT, MANIFEST and its .log merely
 *   because Foundry opened the world, so packs/ is newer than src/packs after
 *   every single server start. It fired on a provably clean tree — and a guard
 *   that always fires is worse than none, because it teaches you to reach for
 *   --force, which is exactly the reflex that destroys the work.
 *
 *   Comparing packs/ against src/packs directly. Also wrong, and dangerously
 *   plausible: "different" has no DIRECTION. Editing YAML and then building is
 *   the normal workflow and makes the two differ just as surely as editing a
 *   compendium does, so that guard would have blocked ordinary content work
 *   while claiming to protect it. The marker is what supplies direction: it
 *   answers "did packs/ move on its own since we last agreed", which is the
 *   only question that matters here.
 *
 * The marker is gitignored and disposable. If it is missing (fresh clone, first
 * ever build) there is no baseline to compare against, so the build proceeds
 * without one: a fresh clone has nothing to lose. This repo has no backup
 * script; the guard's refusal is the only protection.
 *
 * In THIS system the only pack is the rules journal, generated from
 * docs/player-facing-rules.md and the odds table. An edit made to it inside
 * Foundry belongs in the markdown, never in the YAML (see CLAUDE.md and docs/decisions.md).

/**
 * The fingerprint's canonical form of one document.
 *
 * Hashing the extracted YAML TEXT was the first cut and it made the guard cry
 * wolf: Foundry fills schema defaults into a compendium document merely by
 * loading the world, so the extract that follows carries `_stats` blocks and
 * empty-string members the committed YAML omits, and the hash moves without a
 * single Director keystroke. Twice on 2026-08-13 the guard named five packs and
 * every difference in them was default-filling — and a guard that fires on
 * nothing teaches the same reflex the mtime design did: reach for --force.
 * That reflex is what destroys the work this exists to protect.
 *
 * So the comparison is on MEANING, not bytes:
 *   - `_stats` goes entirely. Every member of it moves on any write, and
 *     modifiedTime moves on writes that changed nothing. Provenance is not this
 *     gate's job: the YAML is written by tools/import/, not by hand.
 *   - `_key` goes: it is derived from the id.
 *   - null, undefined and "" are dropped, because "absent" and "empty" is
 *     exactly the difference default-filling creates. This does NOT hide a
 *     Director clearing a field: the repo side still holds the old text, so text
 *     against absent still differs. Only empty-against-empty collapses.
 *   - keys are sorted, so serialization order cannot register as change.
